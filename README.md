## Getting Started

Revisit the following lessons to complete this challenge:


> **Important:** In the module project, you used webpack to create the `manifest.json` file. For this application, you’ll need to create it manually and add it to the `public/` directory of your application. You can also review **Module 19: Progressive Web Applications (PWA), Lesson 5: PWA** as a refresher on web manifests.

### Deployment to Heroku Using MongoDB Atlas

Finally, the budget tracker has a server and uses MongoDB as its database, so you’ll need to deploy this application to Heroku using MongoDB Atlas. To review this process, look at Module 18: NoSQL, Lesson 5: Add Mongoose Validation, specifically 18.5.5: Deploy to Heroku.
